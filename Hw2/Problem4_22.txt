Create a function that returns the height of a subtree.
This function will be recursively called starting at the root of the tree.
The function will return one more than whatever is larger between the height of the left and right subtree.
The base case of the recursive function is a node whose child is NULL; having a child == NULL means that that subtree's height is 0.
If at any point the left and right subtrees have a height difference greater than one, a class variable denoting whether the tree is balanced is set to false.
Since every node is accessed exactly once, the algorithm is O(n) or linear is growth.
