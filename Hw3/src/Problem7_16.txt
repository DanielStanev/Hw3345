Start with an array of size n.

since merge sort splits it into chunks
a variable k will keep track of the size.

k = 1 // size of chunks

for (; k <= n ; k *= 2) // iterates until k reaches n, update condition doubles keep
    i = 0
    for (; i <= n - k; i += 2k)
        inplace merge the subarrays: 
        (i through i + k - 1) and 
        (i + k through the min of (i - 1 + 2k and k - 1))
