a)  If the mergesort implementation checks if the input is sorted beforehand,
    the complexity is O(n), otherwise it is O(n log(n)).

b)  Since mergesort breaks down the input into its smallest units and sorts them
    as it combines them the, it executes with a complexity of O(n log(n)).

c)  Since the worst case complexity of mergesort is O(n log(n)), 
    we can expect a random input to have the same performance.

    Basically all 3 cases have the complexity O(n log(n)) unless a check
    for special cases is implemented.
